# Study-of-64x64-bit-Vedic-Multiplier
This Project include implementation of 64x64 bit Vedic multipliers using two of the sixteen Sutras from ancient Indian literature namely Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah and Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra in Xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL.

## Abstract
Multipliers play a vital role in various fields, including modern digital signal processing (DSP), high-speed arithmetic logic units (ALUs), microcomputers, and image processing. However, multiplication requires more computing power and hardware resources than addition and subtraction. As portable electronics have become more popular, de- signers are seeking ways to improve the efficiency of current designs to enhance performance. Vedic mathematics, which features 16 sutras, provides effective techniques for multiplication, particularly the "Urdhva Tiryagbhyam" and "Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah" sutras. This article concentrates on implementing these sutras to multiply two 64x64 binary numbers using a Vedic multiplier, implemented and simulated using Verilog HDL in Xilinx Vivado 2020.2.

KEYWORDS: Vedic sutras; Urdhva Tiryagbhyam; Nikhilam NavatashcaramamDashatah; Verilog HDL.

## Objective of the work
The primary objective of this project is to :-

• Understanding logic behind each one Vedic Sutras.

– Urdhva Tiryagbhyam.

– Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah.

• Understanding different techniques to reduce the latency of vedic multiplier using these Sutras.

• Implementing 64x64 vedic multipliers for binary number system in xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL.

• Performing the delay and area analysis of these multipliers.

## Conclusion
In this paper I studied vedic multipliers using two of the sixteen sutra from ancient Indian vedic literature. Namely Nikhilam Navatascaramam Dasatah Sutra and Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra. In this report I went through and studied the logic behind both the algorithm Nikhilam Navatascaraman Sasatah Sutra and Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra. This report also contains the Implementing of 64x64 vedic multipliers using Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra for binary number system in xilinx Vivado using verilog HDL and performed delay and area analysis of the multiplier (Using Urdhva Tiryagbyam Sutra).
